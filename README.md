# Convolutional Neural Networks for Novice (CNN)
This is a journal club I decided to make with NIH Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) to familirize students with basic concepts of convolutional neural networks.

## Slides Folder
The slides folder contains the slides for every meeting in this journal club.

### Demos Folder
The demos folder contain jupyter notebooks of sample sampele networks.

## Note
This is not a comprehensive introduction to CNN, but it is just an ice breaker. There a lot more to say.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank OITE (i.e., the organizer), Dr. Stanley Liang (i.e., the co-leader), and everyone who made this happen.
